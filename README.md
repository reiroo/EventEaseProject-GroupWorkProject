Our project is called EventEase for the ease of students, educators, and administrators organize and manage academic-related tasks and schedules effectively. 
This application allows students to schedule academic tasks like assignment due dates, exam schedules, and study sessions. 
Educators can use it to plan classes, meetings, and grading deadlines. 
Administrators can also benefit by scheduling school events, parent-teacher meetings, and institutional announcements

The primary objective of this project is to provide a simple yet powerful platform that facilitates seamless academic schedule management. The application will deliver timely reminders to its users, helping them stay on track with their responsibilities and commitments. By focusing on improving time management skills, this tool will foster greater productivity among its users.
In addition, the project is committed to creating a user-friendly interface that ensures accessibility for all target users. To achieve scalability and reliability, the application will be built using Laravelâ€™s MVC framework, leveraging its robust architecture and efficient performance capabilities

The instructions to our application is simple as it seems. 
1. User signs in to our website
2. If user doesn't have an account then the user may sign up/register to create an account
3. The user is redirected to the main page, the dashboard
4. To use the functions of our app, the user has to press the "+" icon at the bottom right to emerge the pop-up menu
5. The pop-up menu will then ask the user to input details on what to remind them on such as the name of the reminder, the date, the time, and any notes to be reminded of.
6. The user also can change the color of the reminder to any color they want for the ease of diversity.
7. After the user has input the details, they will see the main page again with the reminder on the dashboard.
8. If the user wants to delete a reminder, they can press the "delete" sign at the top right of the reminder.
9. Once everything has done, the user can logout by pressing the top right of the main page to log out of the application.
